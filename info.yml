    menu_name:

        default_value: "Load Objects..."
        description: Name to appear on the Tank menu.

    sg_entity_types:
        type: dict
        description: "Types of Shotgun entities to present in the left-most column in the browser.
                      Typically these are Shots and Assets but could also be Mocap Takes, Elements
                      or custom entities. The value should be organized as a dictionary, where the 
                      key is the Entity Type and the value is a list of Shotgun filters that will be
                      used when retrieving the list of items. If no filter is specified, all items
                      will be loaded. For example, if you want to display only shots  
                      that are in progress, set the value to 
                      
                      {'Shot': [['sg_status_list', 'is', 'ip']]}"

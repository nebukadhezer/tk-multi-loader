    menu_name:
        type: str
        default_value: "Load Objects..."
        description: Name to appear on the Tank menu.

    sg_entity_types:
        type: dict
        description: "Types of Shotgun entities to present in the left-most column in the browser.
                      Typically these are Shots and Assets but could also be Mocap Takes, Elements
                      or custom entities. The value should be organized as a dictionary, where the 
                      key is the Entity Type and the value is a list of Shotgun filters that will be
                      used when retrieving the list of items. If no filter is specified, all items
                      will be loaded. For example, if you want to display only shots  
                      that are in progress, set the value to:
                      
                      	{'Shot': [['sg_status_list', 'is', 'ip']]}
                      
                      Properties from the context can also be used in the shotgun filters. Valid 
                      properties are:
                      
                      	{context.entity}
                      	{context.project}
                      	{context.step}
                      	{context.task}
                      	{context.user}
                      	
                      For example, to show all shots belonging to the project in the current context, 
                      set the value to: 
                      
                      	{'Shot' : [[project, is, '{context.project}']]}"
                      
        default_value: {"Shot": [] }

    publish_filters:
    	type: list
    	description: "List of additional shotgun filters to apply to the publish listings.  These
    				  are in addition to filtering on current entity and any specified tank_types.
    				  
    				  Context properties can also be used in publish filters.  For example, to show
    				  all publishes for the user in the current context, set the value to:
    				  
    				  	[[created_by, is, '{context.user}']"

    	allows_empty: True

        description: Called when a file is loaded. The file_path parameter will contain a path 
                     to the file on disk to load and the shotgun_data parameter is a dictionary
